# Delete tweets older than X days

There are a lot of scripts to do it online, but I decided to do one myself to explore the twitter api and `python-twitter` package.

Based on: https://github.com/bear/python-twitter/blob/master/examples/get_all_user_tweets.py

Add your API credentials to the file `credentials.py`
